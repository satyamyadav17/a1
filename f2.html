                   This is mostly done to steal the identity of any authorized user, rob confidential data, degrade performance, spy on a device, disrupt a service, and/or disable the targeted network or system for the sole purpose of misusing data or exploiting resources. Acting as purposely malignant, malware is disguised as an authentic application available from an apparently trustworthy source.
The modern and common types of malware, such as the viruses, worms, spyware, adware, Trojans, and Zombies, primarily target confidential personal, business, or financial information. The victims could be big companies, small agencies, governments, or even individual users. For achieving the set goal, a malware program must execute without being noticed or deleted, or without shutting down the targeted system. Well, these three criteria also show the way to stop malware attacks and online identity theft. So, the best defense is to beat the malware in its own game.
While no solo technique is 100% infallible, a few tested and trustworthy cyber security techniques are available for keeping malware attacks and online thefts away. If used together, they can easily protect your identity, device, and network from the most vicious but genuine-looking Internet applications.

                    How is the Internet shared between continents?  Answer: Via submarine communications transatlantic cable, a cable laid on the sea bed between land-based stations to carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean.  The cable is used for various sorts of telecom traffic, including the Internet.  Satellites orbiting the planet also help to supplement communications, relaying signals over long distances or as backup in the event of communications failure.  Cable is preferred over satellite due to the much lower latency and higher bandwidth it achieves.
The first submarine communications cables carried telegraphy traffic.
The first communications occurred August 16, 1858, reducing the communication time between North America and Europe from ten days – the time it took to deliver a message by ship – to a matter of minutes. Transatlantic telegraph cables have been replaced by transatlantic telecommunications cables.  The cable consisted of seven copper wires, each weighing 26 kg/km (107 pounds per nautical mile), covered with three coats of gutta-percha, weighing 64 kg/km (261 pounds per nautical mile), and wound with tarred hemp, over which a sheath of 18 strands, each of seven iron wires, was laid in a close spiral. It weighed nearly 550 kg/km.

                    <h1>Method to predict surface ozone pollution levels provides 48-hour heads-up</h1>

                    The method, called regression in self-organizing map (REGiS), weighs and combines statistical air quality models by pairing them with predicted weather patterns to create probabilistic ozone forecasts. Unlike current chemical transport models, REGiS can predict ozone levels up to 48 hours in advance without requiring significant computational power.

Nikolay Balashov, who recently earned his doctorate in meteorology from Penn State, designed this new method by exploring the relationship between air pollutants and meteorological variables.

Because ozone levels are higher in heavily populated areas, particularly on the West Coast of the U.S., the model helps air quality forecasters and decision-makers alert residents in advance and promotes mitigation methods, such as public transportation, in an effort to avoid conditions conducive to unhealthy ozone level formation.

"If we can predict the level of ozone ahead of time, then it's possible that we can do something to combat it," said Balashov. "Ozone needs sunlight but it also needs other precursors to form in the atmosphere, such as chemicals found in vehicle emissions. Reducing vehicle use (on the days when the weather is conducive to the formation of unhealthy ozone concentrations) will reduce the level of emissions that contribute to higher levels of ozone pollution."

This new tool for air quality forecasters allows for the evaluation of various ozone pollution scenarios and offers insight into which weather patterns may worsen surface ozone pollution episodes. For example, higher surface temperatures, dry conditions and lighter wind speeds tend to lead to higher surface ozone. The researchers published their results in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology.
